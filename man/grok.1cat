       ggrrookk  is  a database manager that displays two-dimensional
       databases using a card file paradigm.  A  GUI  builder  is
       available  to create user-defined applications. Grok comes
       with a number of pre-built applications such  as  a  phone
       directory,  todo lists, and a sample country database. The
       form to display (_p_h_o_n_e,  _t_o_d_o,  _c_o_u_n_t_r_i_e_s,  etc.)  can  be
       given  as  the first parameter. This manual page describes
       the command line options of ggrrookk.  For information on  how
       to  use  ggrrookk, refer to the on-line help pages, and to the
       PostScript or TeX manual.

       -h     List available options.

       -d     Print fallback X resources and exit. The output can
              be  appended  directly to the ~/.Xdefaults file for
              modification  of  the  geometry,  color,  and  font
              defaults.

       -v     Print  the program version and patchlevel and exit.

       -t     Requires specification of a form. Without  a  query
              string, prints all cards to stdout in the same for-
              mat that is used for the summary window in interac-
              tive mode. If a query is also specified, print only
              cards  that  satisfy  the  query  expression   (see
              below). The form may have a default query built in.

       -T     This option is equivalent  to  -t,  but  omits  the
              header line.

       -p     This  option  is  equivalent  to -p, but prints the
              data in a format readable by the _p_l_a_n calendar pro-
              gram (see www.bitrot.de/plan.html). The format is a
              colon-separated  list:  date/time,  length,   early
              warn, late warn, day repeat, end date, color, note,
              message, script, suspend flag,  no-time  flag,  and
              no-alarm flag. Colons, newlines, and backslashes in
              fields are escaped with a backslash.  If  no  query
              string  is given, the default plan query defined in
              the form is used.

       -f     Don't fork on startup. This is  useful  for  debug-
              ging.

       form   Specifies    the   database   to   display.    GGrrookk



                                                                1

              distinguishes forms and databases. Both always come
              in  pairs.  The  form defines the representation of
              the cards and the database provides the  raw  data.
              If  no  form  is  specified,  one  can be chosen in
              interactive  mode.  The  -t,  -T,  and  -p  options
              require a form argument.

       query  If  the  form  has  a built-in query, it is used to
              select which cards in the database to display  ini-
              tially. If there is no default query, all cards are
              displayed. The query argument can be used to  over-
              ride  the default query.  This option should always
              be quoted with single quotes to keep the shell from
              interpreting the query string.

       There  are  different  types  of  queries: '*' selects all
       cards,  '/string'  performs  a   case-insensitive   string
       search,  '{expr}'  selects  all cards for which the string
       expression  returns  a  non-null,  non-'f'   string,   and
       '(expr)' selects all cards for which the numerical expres-
       sion returns nonzero. The leading '/' in  string  searches
       is  optional.  For a detailed description of query expres-
       sions, refer to the "Expression Grammar" item in the  help
       pulldown, or to the PostScript user's manual.

       In  addition  to  these options, ggrrookk supports the usual X
       options such as -iconic. The -geometry option  should  not
       be  used to preset a window size; grok determines and fre-
       quently adjusts its own size.

       ggrrookk

       Start up grok with no form. The Database pulldown  can  be
       used to choose one.

       ggrrookk pphhoonnee

       Start  up  grok  with  the _p_h_o_n_e form. Perform that form's
       default query if it has one.

       ggrrookk pphhoonnee ''//tthhoommaass''

       Start up grok with the  _p_h_o_n_e  form.  Ignore  the  default
       query   and  select  only  cards  that  contain  the  word
       "thomas". Case is ignored.

       ggrrookk --tt pphhoonnee ''//tthhoommaass''

       Print all cards of the form _p_h_o_n_e to stdout  that  contain
       the  string  "thomas".  Do  not start the interactive user
       interface.

GROK(1L)                                                 GROK(1L)


       Start up grok with the  _p_h_o_n_e  form.  Ignore  the  default
       query  and  select  only  cards that describe friends that
       have an email address.

       Below, GBIN and GLIB refer to the installation directories
       specified  at the beginning of the Imakefile when the pro-
       grams  were  compiled.   They   are   /usr/local/bin   and
       /usr/local/lib, respectively, by default.

       *.gf              Files  ending with the extension .gf are
                         assumed to contain ggrrookk forms.

       *.db              Unless the form specifies otherwise, the
                         database  that provides the raw data for
                         a form has the same path and name as the
                         form, but with the extension .db. Proce-
                         dural databases have no extension.

       .                 The current directory is searched  first
                         for form files.

       ./grokdir         The   grokdir   current   directory   is
                         searched next for form  files.  This  is
                         done  to  allow  ggrrookk to be started from
                         the source  distribution  directory  for
                         evaluation.

       ~/.grok           By  default, all forms and databases are
                         stored here. By convention, all  private
                         forms  and  databases  are  stored here.
                         This directory is searched after  .  and
                         ./grokdir.

       GLIB/grokdir      This  directory  is searched last. It is
                         supposed to contain forms visible to all
                         users  of a system. Only one user should
                         have write permission.

                         set  up  so  they  can  be "executed" by
                         feeding themselves to ggrrookk,, as  long  as
                         ggrrookk is in the search path $PATH.
