grok:2:3:thomas:thomas:14.10.94:30.10.94:::w:regular expression searches:Preferences menu should offer regular expression search, case-insensitive\
(default), case-sensitive. Perhaps ~= operator for expressions.
grok:3:3:thomas:thomas:14.10.94:30.10.94:::w:picture support:Need to have a picture data type. String contains image file name,\
image is displayed in the card.
grok:4:2:thomas:thomas:17.10.94:30.10.94:::f:resizable summary:When the window is resized, the summary should change size. This seems\
to be more difficult than anticipated.
grok:5:3:thomas:thomas:17.10.94:30.10.94:::w:charts:There are lots of interesting things to do with charts\: axis labels,\
grids, scrollbars...

grok:7:2:thomas:thomas:24.10.94:30.10.94:::w:file locking:Need some sort of file locking that would allow multiple users writing\
to the same file. Need separate open-for-write, first user gets it and\

grok:8:3:thomas:thomas:30.10.94:30.10.94:::w:connection to the plan program:There should be some connection to the "plan" day planner program,\
for example for phone log ticklers. Maybe a calendar item type, and\
an appointment-adding statement in the expression language. BTW, if\
you don't know plan and need a calendar and day planner, check it\
out on ftp.fu-berlin.de (file /pub/unix/graphics/plan/plan-1.3.tar.gz).
grok:9:3:thomas:thomas:31.10.94:31.10.94:::w:let one form control multiple databases:Perhaps create a pullright cascade menu in the Database pulldown if\
there is a <formname>.db directory? Can't look at the form contents.
grok:10:3:thomas:thomas:31.10.94:31.10.94:::w:better variables:add submenu in form editor that lets form designer specify the default\
for each variable a..z, -or- specify which variable is read from a\
<databasename>.var file.
