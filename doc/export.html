<H1>Template Exports</H1>

<A NAME="eb">
<H2>Using the Export Function</H2>

<P>The export function in the File pulldown can be used to generate
reports from the data stored in the current database in various
formats. The format is controlled by a <I>template</I>. A template is
a file containing the static text framework that should appear in the
exported file, with embedded expressions that are evaluated as part of
the export process.  These expressions are either standard grok expressions
(see <A HREF="grammar.html">Expression Grammar</A>), or special export
expressions that are available only in export templates, described
below.  Note that exports should not modify the database.  The results
of an expression modifying the database may not be saved, and may be
completely disabled in the future.

<P>If the Export function in the file pulldown is chosen, a dialog
containing a list of available templates is shown. The list begins with
builtin templates that are not actually residing in template files on
disk, but are built in to the grok program itself.  User-defined templates
reside in files in a directory that has the same path and the same name
as the form file for the database, except that the extension ``.gf''
is replaced with the extension ``.tm''.  The directory path can be
displayed with the Database choice in the Help pulldown. For example,
if the form file path is ``~/.grok/phone.gf'', all template files for
the phone database are in the directory ``~/.grok/phone.tm''.  The
name of every file in that directory appears in the list of templates
in the export dialog.

<P>New templates can be created from scratch with the Create button under
the template list. This will ask for the name of the new template and
start an editor with the empty template file. To write a template that
is a variation of an existing template, select the existing template,
press the Dup (duplicate) button, and choose a file name.  This creates
a copy of the template and brings up the editor on it; you can press
cancel to just keep an exact copy.  This method also works for
built-in templates.  The Edit button brings up the editor for
user-created templates, and Delete deletes them (with no undo).

<P>The built-in templates are:

<UL>
<LI><B>html</B><BR>
	The HTML template displays the form name, followed by the
	summary in a table with appearance similar to the GUI summary,
	followed by a detailed card listing in a two-column table
	below the summary.  If both are present, links are provided
	between summary table entries and detail cards.  If the
	summary is present, notes may also be displayed beneath each
	summary line as described below.
<LI><B>text</B><BR>
	The text template produces almost identical output to the
	html template, except in plain text, relying on monospace fonts
	for alignment.  It also doesn't display the form name and
	creation date at the top.
<LI><B>fancytext</B><BR>
	The fancytext template produces almost identical output to the
	text template, except that overstrike is used to apply bolding
	and underlining to parts of the output.
<LI><B>sql</B><BR>
	The sql template produces a standard SQL script to create a table with
	a similar structure to the form.  The database name and field names
	are assumed to be valid SQL.  Some manual editing may still be
	needed to adjust data types to your target database and perform
	any other desired tweaks.  The table is created with the same name
	as the grok database.  If the summary listing is enabled, a view is
	created with the same name, but with <TT>_sum</TT>  appended.  If
	data listing is enabled, a view is created with the same name, but
	with <TT>_view</TT> appended.  The views name their columns using
	the labels, rather than the raw field names, and attempt to adjust the
	data to look more user-friendly.  Except for Flag and
	multi-column fields, data is exported verbatim. Flags and
	multi-column fields are exported as booleans (TRUE or
	FALSE) rather than the raw flag codes.
</UL>

<P>Some templates may also support flags; setting these can be
considered part of selecting the template.  Flags a through z may be
set in the field below the template list.  All unspecified flags are
unset.  The flags may be given raw or prefixed individually with a
dash.

<P>The built-in templates normally export a summary listing, followed
by a detailed card listing.  This can be modified with the following
flags:

<UL>
<LI> <B>-s</B> disables the card listing ("summary only").
<LI> <B>-d</B> disables the summary listing ("data only").  Note that
if both -s and -d are specified, neither listing will be included.
<LI> <B>-n</B> includes non-blank Note field contents into the
summary listing, if present.  This does not affect the sql template.
</UL>

<P>In the GUI, the above three flags are exposed through checkboxes.
The Summary checkbox shows and sets the inverse of the d flag.  The
Notes checkbox shoes and sets the n flag.  The Cards checkbox shows
and sets the inverse of the s flag.  Specifying any of the three flags
in the text box adjusts the checkboxes and removes them from the text,
as they are meant to only be managed via the checkboxes.

<P>Since some aspects of database creation and data types are not well
standardized (or not well supported), the built-in SQL template makes
its SQL compatible with specific databases.  By default, an attempt is
made to make the SQL compatible with SQLite 3.  There are two flags to
support other databases, instead:

<UL>
<LI> <B>-p</B> attempts to make the SQL compatible with PostgreSQL 13.
It may be compatible with other versions, as well; earlier tests were
made with version 12 at least.
<LI> <B>-f</B> attempts to make the SQL compatible with Firebird 3.
It may be compatible with later versions, as well.
</UL>

<P>After selecting a template, the full path of the output file
must be entered into the text field under the template list, or
selected using the Browse button.  Instead of a file name, a command
may be specified by prefixing it with a vertical bar (|).  The
template output will then be piped into the standard input of that
command.

<P>When both the template and the output file are defined, the Export
button performs the export operation and removes the dialog.  Note
that it is possible to write templates that ignore the output file
name in the dialog and write to one or more files defined in the
template. None of the builtin templates do that.

<P>Alternately, if grok can parse the output, you can preview the
output in a window by presing the Preview button (without having to
specify a file first).  A simple algorithm is used to support HTML,
plain text, and overstrike text.

<P>Template exports can also be started from the command line. The command

<PRE>
     grok -x phone html /415 > phone.html
</PRE>

<P>creates a file phone.html containing all entries of the database <I>
phone</I> that satisfy the search expression or search string <I>/415</I>
(an area code, perhaps) in HTML format.  <I>html</I> is one of the
built-in template names.  The search expression is optional. Commands
like this could be run hourly from the crontab to update a HTML web page
from a grok database.

<P>To specify flags on the command-line, append each flag to set to
the template name as a dash, followed by the flag letter.  If no
template is found with the given name, a flag is stripped off the end,
set, and the search is restarted.  Any number of flags can be given in
this way.

<P>For example, the following command only exports the summary
listing with notes:

<PRE>
     grok -x phone html-s-n /415 > phone.html
</PRE>

<P>A template may also be piped into grok directly using the special
template name <TT>+</TT>.  For example, to just print a few fields
(see below for how to interpret this template):

<PRE>
     echo '\{FOREACH}\{_phone}:\{_name}
     \{END}' | grok -x phone + /415
</PRE>

<P>The automatic templates (and any others as well, including
<TT>+</TT> if you want an expensive <TT>cat</TT> command) can be
viewed directly from the comand line using the <TT>-X</TT> option.
This just copies the raw template (without evaluation) to standard
output.  A form must still be specified, as each form has its own set
of templates.  Any search string or flags are simply ignored.

<PRE>
     grok -X phone html > phone-html-template
</PRE>

<A NAME="ec">
<H2>Writing Custom Templates</H2>

<P>The export output file is basically a copy of the template. Normal text
in the template is copied to the output file unchanged, including all
white space, tabs, newlines, and other control characters. Expressions
that are enclosed in <TT>\{</TT> (backslash directly followed by an
opening brace) and <TT>}</TT> (closing brace) are not copied verbatim
but are evaluated. The result of the evaluation is copied into the export
output file. For example, the following text fragment in a template:

<PRE>
     Six multiplied by eight is \{(6*8)}, approximately.
</PRE>

<P>produces the following text in the output file:

<PRE>
     Six multiplied by eight is 48, approximately.
</PRE>

<P>Note that the <TT>\{...}</TT> notation puts the expression parser in
string mode, so inner parentheses had to be used to evaluate a numerical
expression. There is no <TT>\(...)</TT> syntax that would permit
numerical expressions directly. Backslashes followed by any character
other than an open brace escapes the next character.  Any backslashes
being used as anything other than introducing expressions must be
escaped by doubling them. The <TT>switch</TT> statement is ignored in
a template; use <TT>@</TT> or field juxtaposition in appropriate
places to access other databases instead.

<P>Most templates use more complicated expressions that reference fields
in the database. For example, suppose an export file is to be generated
from the <I>phone</I> database that is part of the grok distribution.
The form for this database contains the fields ``name'' and ``phone''
whose values can be referenced in expressions by prefixing an underscore
(again, refer to Expression Grammar for details). A template can be
written that contains the following text:

<PRE>
     The phone number of \{_name} is \{_phone=="" ? "unknown" : _phone}.
</PRE>

<P>This expression substitutes the name of the current card and the
phone number if it exists (i.e. is not the empty string) or the text
``unknown'' otherwise. However, this expression is not useful by itself
because it always references the first card in the database. Template
expressions are provided that allow looping over all or selected
cards of the database, excluding parts of the template, or define text
substitutions for expression results that contain characters not allowed
in the output file. The <I>phone</I> template above can be made to loop
over all cards in the current query by rewriting it:

<PRE>
     Phone directory:
     
     \{FOREACH}

     The phone number of \{_name} is \{_phone=="" ? "unknown" : _phone}.

     \{END}
</PRE>

<P>All template expressions begin with a capitalized command word to
distinguish them from regular grok expressions. Template expressions
can be used in template files only; they cause syntax errors elsewhere.
If a template expression is directly followed by a newline, the newline is
ignored; this makes templates more legible because commands like FOREACH
can be put into lines of their own without introducing unwanted newlines.

<A NAME="ed">
<H2>Template Expression Summary</H2>

<P>Here is a list of all supported template expressions:

<UL>
<LI><TT>\{FOREACH</TT> <TT>@</TT> <I>dbname</I> <TT>+</TT> <I>fieldname</I> <TT>-</TT> <I>fieldname</I> ... <I>expr</I><TT>}</TT> <I>text</I> <TT>\{END}</TT><BR>
	The text between the <TT>FOREACH</TT> and <TT>END</TT> commands
	is executed once for every card for which the query expression
	<I>expr</I> is true.  Every card is considered in the order of
	the most recent sort, and the query expression is executed. If
	it returns false (numerical value 0 or empty string or string
	beginning with "f") the parser skips to the matching END without
	evaluating <I>text</I> and considers the next card until the last
	card has been executed. The <I>text</I> can contain expressions
	and template expressions.  <TT>FOREACH</TT> loops can be nested
	20 levels deep.<P>

	The query expression <I>expr</I> is optional; if it is missing
	the most recent query from the enclosing <TT>FOREACH</TT> loop is
	used, or if there is none, the last query from the command line
	or from the Query pulldown or from a text search in the main
	menu is used. It is recommended to not use query expressions
	because they make the -x command-line option less useful.<P>

	The loop may be executed in a foreign database by adding the
	optional <TT>@</TT> <I>dbname</I> prefix.  The <I>dbname</I>
	may either be a string literal (enclosed by single or double
	quotes, with backslash escaping the next character within the
	quotes), a string expression enclosed in curly braces, or a
	literal word which is terminated by the next +, -, or space.
	Within the loop and the search expression, all variable and
	field references refer to the foreign database.  The field
	names for sorts also refer to the foreign database.  However,
	the expressions used to generate the field names and the
	database name (if the curly brace form is used) are still
	evaluated in the context of the enclosing database.<P>

	The sort order may be modified by adding one or more optional
	sort specifiers consisting of a sign and a <I>fieldname</I>.  The
	plus sign indicates ascending order, and the minus descending.
	Field names support the same three formats as the <I>dbname</I>.
	The leading underscore of the field name is optional.  When
	accessing a foreign database, if there is no sort order specified,
	the default order for that database is used.<P>

<LI><TT>\{FOREACH [</TT><I>var</I> <I>expr</I><TT>}</TT> <I>text</I> <TT>\{END}</TT><BR>
    <TT>\{FOREACH [+</TT><I>var</I> <I>expr</I><TT>}</TT> <I>text</I> <TT>\{END}</TT><BR>
	The text between the <TT>FOREACH</TT> and <TT>END</TT> commands
	is executed once for every element of the array given by
	<I>expr</I>, in much the same way as database iteration above.
	For each iteration, the array element is assigned to <I>var</I>
	before evaluating <I>text</I>.  The variable name (<I>var</I>)
	may optionally be prefixed with a plus-sign (<TT>+</TT>) to only
	evaluate <I>text</I> for non-empty array elements.<P>

<LI><TT>\{IF</TT> <I>expr</I><TT>}</TT> <I>text</I> <TT>\{ELSEIF <I>expr</I>}</TT> <I>text</I> <TT>\{ELSE}</TT> <I>text</I> <TT>\{ENDIF}</TT><BR>
	Conditional expressions evaluate text only if the expression
	<I>expr</I> is true. Otherwise <I>text</I> is ignored. The
	<I>text</I> may contain expressions and template expressions,
	including <TT>FOREACH</TT> loops and other conditionals.
	IF statements can be nested arbitrarily.  Any <TT>FOREACH</TT>
	within a text segment must also have its matching <TT>END</TT>
	in the same text segment, at the same nesting level.<P>

	The <I>text</I> may also contain <TT>ELSEIF</TT> at the
	same nesting level, which is evaluated only if all prior
	conditions were false; the text after it is then executed only
	if its own <I>expr</I> evaluates to true.  There may be none
	or as many <TT>ELSEIF</TT> directives as desired before the
	<TT>ENDIF</TT>.  Similarly, <TT>ELSE</TT> is evaluated only if
	all prior conditions were false; this is then executed
	always.  Either no or exactly one <TT>ELSE</TT> should be
	present, and any further <TT>ELSE</TT> or <TT>ELSEIF</TT>
	directives following that are completely ignored, although they
	may trigger an error in a future release.  In short, either
	only one branch of <I>text</I> is evaluated, or none.<P>

	As described above, the user may specify one or more flags to
	be set for an export, each corresponding to one of the 26
	letters a through z,  The <I>expr</I> for <TT>IF</TT> may test
	for such a flag being set using <TT>-</TT><I>flag</I> and unset
	using <TT>+</TT><I>flag</I>.  See the built-in templates for
	examples of their usage.

<LI><TT>\{SUBST</TT> <I>c</I><TT>=</TT><I>string c</I><TT>=</TT><I>string</I> ... <TT>}</TT><BR>
	Some characters are unwanted in output files. For example,
	angle brackets ``<TT>&lt;&nbsp;&gt;</TT>'' have a special
	meaning in HTML files, so the result of an expression that
	is placed in the output file must be adjusted to avoid these
	characters. This is done by providing substitutions for these
	special characters. The <TT>SUBST</TT> statement assigns an
	arbitrary string <I>string</I> to a character <I>c</I> that is
	substituted for every occurrence of <I>c</I> in the result of
	an expression. Both <I>c</I> and <I>string</I> may contain a
	backslash followed by an octal number, or ``<TT>t</TT>'' for a
	tab, or ``<TT>n</TT>'' for a newline. Blanks in <I>string</I>
	must be given as ``<TT>\040</TT>''.  For example, a
	template creating an HTML file may contain the substitutions
	``<TT>&lt;=&amp;lt;</TT>'' and ``<TT>\n=&lt;BR&gt;</TT>''. Later
	substitutions of the same <I>c</I> override earlier ones.<P>

<LI><TT>\{SUBST HTML}</TT><BR>
	This is a shorthand for substitutions required in HTML
	documents. It substitutes angle brackets, ampersands, and
	newlines.  If newlines should not be preserved, follow this
	expression with a substitution like ``\n=\n''.<P>

<LI><TT>\{FILE</TT> <I>expr</I><TT>}</TT><BR>
	The expression <I>expr</I> can either be a simple string or a
	string expression enclosed in braces. The result becomes the
	new output file name, and the previous file name specified in
	the export dialog (or stdout if the <TT>-x</TT> command-line
	option is used) is closed. The export function creates a file
	only when the first character is written to it, not when the
	filename is specified.<P>

	<P>The <TT>FILE</TT> command can be used in a template that
	creates form letters. Such a template would begin with a
	<TT>FOREACH</TT> statement followed by a <TT>FILE</TT> statement
	that creates a file whose name is derived from a database field
	or from a counter implemented with a variable.<P>

	<P>As you might have guessed, output following <TT>FILE</TT>
	will also not be sent to the command when exporting to
	one, or shown in the preview window.  When using such
	templates with the Print command, further output will
	also not be printed.

<LI><TT>\{QUIT}</TT><BR>
	This command aborts template evaluation.  It is executed
	automatically when the end of the template file is
	reached. Normally <TT>QUIT</TT> would be given in a conditional
	statement.<P>
