<H1>Introduction</H1>

<P>xmbase-grok was born as ``grok'', but the name was changed later
to this more descriptive variation, and then, later, changed back,
although qtbase-grok would work as well.  It is a simple desktop database
manager, intended to manage small databases such as phone lists,
diaries, todo lists, URL lists, etc. A user interface builder is
integrated in grok to allow customization of the presentation of the
data in the main window. A variety of user interface elements such as
text entry fields, checkbuttons, function buttons, and bar charts can be
placed in the database-dependent part of the main window, called the
<I>card</I>. grok comes with a selection of pre-built applications.

<P>The database itself is organized in a table with rows and columns of
strings. A <I>card</I> presents one row of the database. For example,
the phone list stores one person per row, with various columns for name,
address, phone number, and so on.

<P>In addition to the card, the main window also displays a scrollable
<I>summary</I> listing containing one line per card, allowing fast lookup
of cards. Pressing on a line in the summary puts the corresponding row
into the card part of the window. The main window also contains controls
for searching of cards, and for adding and deleting cards. There are
several methods for searching: by keyword, using the built-in query
language, or using customizable standard queries.

<P>This chapter is intended as a user manual. For details on the
implementation of databases, and for advanced operations such as building
new applications with grok, refer to the chapter
<A HREF="formedit.html">``Creating and Editing Forms''</A>.


<A NAME="ib">
<H2>Starting grok</H2>

<P>From the command line, grok can be started as <TT>grok</TT> with no
arguments. This will bring up an empty card; a database must then be
chosen from the <I>Database</I> pulldown. The database to load can be
specified on the command line, such as <TT>grok&nbsp;phone</TT>.

<P>The <TT>-t</TT>, <TT>-T</TT>, and <TT>-p</TT> options allow queries
printed to stdout, without starting the interactive graphical user
interface. Queries may use simple keyword lookups, or may use the query
language:

<PRE>
     grok -t phone thomas
     grok -t todo '({_status == "t"} &amp;&amp; {_assigned == user})'
</PRE>

<P>For details on the query language used in the second example, refer to
the <A HREF="grammar.html">``Expression Grammar'' chapter</A>. The
first example looks for the given keyword; case distinctions are
ignored. The author of the application controls which columns of the
database are searched for keywords. Note the single quotes enclosing
the query to protect blanks, parentheses, and double quotes from the
shell.

<P>grok supports the following command-line options:</P>

<TT>grok</TT> [<I>options</I>] [<I>database</I> ['<I>query</I>']]<BR>
<TT>grok</TT> -x <I>database</I> <I>template</I>[<I>flags</I>] ['<I>query</I>']]

<UL>
<LI><TT>-h</TT><BR>
	print a short usage message listing the available options.<P>

<LI><TT>-d</TT><BR>
	print the default Qt Style Sheet to stdout and exit. The output
	can be placed in ~/.grok/grok.qss to override the built-in
	style sheet or specified by the standard Qt command-line option
	<TT>-stylesheet=</TT><I>file</I> to augment the built-in style
	sheet.<P>

<LI><TT>-v</TT><BR><BR>
	print the version number of grok.<P>

<LI><TT>-t</TT><BR>
	Perform <I>query</I> and print the matching cards to stdout. If
	<I>query</I> is missing, print all cards. The <I>database</I>
	argument is mandatory for <TT>-t</TT> and <TT>-T</TT>.<P>

<LI><TT>-T</TT><BR>
	Same as <TT>-t</TT>, but omit the header line. This is useful
	when the result is piped to other Unix utilities.<P>

<LI><TT>-p</TT><BR>
	Perform <I>query</I> and print the matching cards to stdout,
	in a format understood by the <I>plan</I> calendar program,
	version 1.9 or higher. If <I>query</I> is missing, use the
	<I>Shown in calendar if</I> expression defined by the database's
	form editor. If that expression is undefined too, print all
	cards. The <I>database</I> argument is mandatory for <TT>-p</TT>.

<LI><TT>-x</TT><BR>
	Evaluate the <I>template</I> and print the results to stdout.
	The format is defined by the template, and the query is
	usually, but not necessarily, used by the template to select
	results.  The template named <TT>+</TT> refers to standard
	input.  Other templates include the built-in templates and
	templates defined for the database.  Any number of flags for
	the template can be appended to the name, each as a dash
	followed by the flag letter (a-z).  See the chapter on
	<A HREF="export.html">exports</A> for details.

<LI><TT>-f</TT><BR>
	Do not fork on startup. This is mainly a debugging tool; it
	prevents grok from putting itself into the background.<P>

<LI><TT>-r</TT><BR>
	Restricted <TT>grok</TT>. The form editor is disabled to
	prevent inexperienced users from inadvertently starting the user
	interface builder (called the ``form editor'') and modifying
	the current database format. The same effect can be achieved by
	linking <TT>grok</TT> to <TT>rgrok</TT>; running <TT>rgrok</TT>
	has the same effect as running <TT>grok&nbsp;-r</TT>.<P>

</UL>

In addition, the standard Qt command-line options are supported.
At the time of this writing, they are documented at the
<A HREF="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qguiapplication.html#QGuiApplication">QGuiApplication
constructor documentation</A> and the
<A HREF="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qapplication.html#QApplication">QApplication
constructor documentation</A>.  Note that these are only recognized if
the application's GUI is started, and they may be placed anywhere as
they are essentially removed by Qt itself before the above arguments
are processed.  Some important options are:

<UL>
<LI><TT>-style=</TT><I>style</I> <TT>-style</TT> <I>style</I><BR>
	Changes the entire appearance of the application.  Available
	style plugins vary by installation.  One particular style of
	note, since this application used to be MOtif-based, is the
	<A HREF="https://github.com/qt/qtstyleplugins.git">motif</A>
	plugin.  The style can also be overridden using the
	environment variable <TT>QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE</TT>.
<LI><TT>-stylesheet=</TT><I>file</I> <TT>-stylesheet</TT> <I>file</I><BR>
	As mentioned above, the <I>file</I> contains a Qt Style Sheet that
	supplements and overrides (rather than replaces) the built-in
	style sheet.

<A NAME="ic">
<H2>The Main Window</H2>

<P>When grok is started, it presents a four-part window: a search area
for entering keywords and query expressions, the summary, the card, and
a row of buttons for creating, deleting, and modifying cards. There is
also a menu bar with pulldown menus.

<P>When grok is started up without arguments, it is first necessary to
choose the database to display from the <TT>Database</TT> pulldown.
This pulldown presents all files in the <TT>~/.grok</TT> directory
that end with the extension <TT>.gf</TT>, with the extension removed.
(If a new database is created, it is not necessary to choose a database,
see <A HREF="formedit.html">next chapter</A>.) Sometimes, the Database
pulldown shows some databases more than once. The reason is usually
that the database is found in two different places or using different
paths; the duplicates can be eliminated by enabling the ``Don't show
duplicate databases'' in the preferences menu available under the
``File'' pulldown.

<P>The next step is choosing a <I>section</I> of the database. Not
all databases have section; if the <TT>Section</TT> pulldown in the
menu bar is grayed out, this step can be omitted. grok normally loads
its string table containing the cards from a file ending with the
extension <TT>.db</TT>, usually with the same directory and root name
as the <TT>.gf</TT> file. If this <TT>.db</TT> file is a directory, grok
recursively loads all files ending with <TT>.db</TT> in this directory,
and combines them into one database in memory. Each file becomes a
<I>section</I>. By default, all sections are displayed after loading
a database, but the Section pulldown allows restricting the summary
listing to a single section (file). To create a new section, choose
``New...'' in the Section pulldown; if the database did not have sections
until now all its cards are put into the new section. Otherwise, the new
section is created empty. There is no way to delete sections, other than
using a shell to delete the file named <I>sectionname</I><TT>.db</TT>
in the database directory.

<P>The main window now displays all cards in the chosen database, or
section of the database if chosen, in the summary listing. To display any
card listed in the summary, press on this line. The card appears in the
bottom part of the window and can now be edited (unless the database
file was read-only, or the application author has restricted write
access). Text entry fields normally have a pink background; read-only
text fields have a gray background.

<P>Below the card, there are buttons to skip to the next or previous
card, to create a new card (<I>New</I>), to duplicate the currently
displayed card, or to delete the currently displayed card. New cards
may be created with defaults specified by the application designer. If
the database has sections, there is an additional menu button that
moves the card into a different section.

<P>grok can optionally display a row of letter buttons below the summary
area that restrict the summary to display only cards whose first text
field begins with the selected letter. Case is not distinguished; leading
white space and punctuation is ignored.  The row of letter buttons can
be enabled or disabled with the ``Enable search by initial letter''
mode in the preferences menu that can be called with the ``Preferences''
choice in the ``File'' pulldown. The ``Letter search checks all words''
mode in the same menu extends the letter search to check all words in
the first text field of each card, instead of just the first.

<A NAME="id">
<H2>Searches and Queries</H2>

<P>The Search text entry field near the top of the window allows entry of
a search string. Case is not significant. The entire string is searched
for; the number of blanks and punctuation is significant.  The search
string is <I>not</I> a sequence of keywords. This type of search is
equivalent to what the Unix command <TT>fgrep&nbsp;-i</TT> does.

<P>More sophisticated queries can be performed by entering a query
expression beginning with <TT>(</TT> or <TT>{</TT>. For a description
of the syntax and the difference between parenthesized and braced
expressions, the the <A HREF="grammar.html">``Expression Grammar''</A>
chapter. To get a feel for expressions, enable ``Show query search
expressions'' in the preferences menu and choose a canned query from
the ``Query'' pulldown. The query expression will be shown in the
Search text field and can then be edited there.

<P>The Query pulldown always begins with the ``All'' choice that puts
all cards in the database, or all cards in the current section if one
was selected with the Section pulldown, into the summary listing.
The application designer may predefine canned queries (using the
``Queries'' button in the form editor) that appear in the Query pulldown.

<P>If the ``Incremental searches and queries'' mode in the preferences
menu is enabled, each new search or query only checks the cards already
in the summary, thus narrowing the previous search or query.  To return
to a complete listing, choose ``All'' in the Query pulldown.  If the
incremental mode is disabled, all cards are checked.

<!-- FIXME: document search type menu button -->

<A NAME="ie">
<H2>Printing</H2>

<P>The File pulldown has a ``Print...'' choice that pops up the
printing menu. It allows selecting the cards to print and the output
format.  These formats always include the built-in HTML, text, and
fancy text options; they may also have database-specific formats
created for exporting; see below.  Normally, HTML is the best option.
The other two are retained to match the old print functionality.  The
text format is plain text in a typewriter font wrapped or truncated to
the ``Text export line Length'' preference.  The fancy text format is the
same, but text overstrike is used to add underlining and bolding.

<P>Each output format may also support flags, which can be entered in
the text field as the letters a-z.  The default formats support
Summary, Notes, and Cards flags.  If Summary is set, the summary
listing will be included.  If Notes is also set, all fields of type
Note will be interspersed, unlabeled, in the summary listing under
their row.  If Cards is set, a detail listing of all cards will be
included below the summary, if present.

<P>The Preview button then provides a grphic preview before printing
(which can be begun using a button in the preview interface), and the
Print button goes straight to the printer selection.  These two allow
adjustment of other print options, such as paper size, page selection,
and printer name.  Always use the Preview button first if you are
unsure that the output format will be to your liking.

<A NAME="if">
<H2>Exporting</H2>

<P>The File pulldown also has an ``Export...'' choice that pops up the
Export menu. Exporting means creating one or more files that contain the
data in the current database, or a subset of this data, in a particular
format controlled by a <I>template</I>.  You may notice that the
listed templates are the same as for printing; this is no
coincidence.  Templates also define the printer output format.  The
built-in templates create HTML, plain text, and overstrike text, as
described above.  It is also possible to write custom templates using
the buttons below the template list.  For details, see the chapter
<A HREF="export.html">``Template Exports''</A>. 

<P>While exporting is very similar to printing, the output destinations
are different.  The Preview button displays the results in a window
(which is not the same as the printing Preview window).  The Export
button exports to a file, specified in the "To File:" text box.  A
file may be selected using a GUI by pressing the "..." button next to
it.  The output may be redirected to a command by giving a command
instead, prefixed with a vertical bar (|).

<A NAME="ig">
<H2>Miscellaneous</H2>

<P>When a database is changed, the changes are not immediately written
to the database file (with the <TT>.db</TT> extension). It is written
when ``Save'' or ``Quit'' in the File pulldown is chosen, or when a
new database is chosen from the Database pulldown.  Closing the window
normally also allows saving.  Killing the program or killing the
window will not save.  The title bar has a * indicator, and the
search text field displays ``(modified)'' if the database has been
changed but not written back.

<P>Note that grok does not attempt to sequence database accesses. It does
not protect databases against simultaneous accesses. Although standard
file locking is used during read and write operations (which may or may
not work across NFS), nobody stops two users from reading the same file,
then both modifying it, and writing it back; one of the two changes will
be lost.

<P>A useful feature is the ``Current database'' choice in the Help
pulldown. It lists all known information about the current database,
including the names and paths of all loaded files and their sizes.

<P>In case of trouble, it is <B>strongly</B> recommended to read the
other help texts available under the Help pulldown, especially the
``Troubleshooting'' section. The Help pulldown will only work if the
<TT>grok.hlp</TT> file is installed in ${GROK_LIB}.
