<H1>Creating and Editing Forms</H1>

<P>grok distinguishes databases and forms. A database is an array of
unformatted data, while the form specifies the structure of the data
and describes how to display it in a card. The standard user interface
that comes up when grok is started deals with database presentation and
modification; to edit the presentation, or to create a new database,
start the form editor from the File pulldown in the main window.

<P>The form editor is a separate pair of windows that is rather more
complicated than the standard database user interface. It is basically
a simple UI builder that allows the user to create and position UI
elements in a card.

<A NAME="mb">
<H2>General Setup</H2>

<P>The first step when creating a new database is choosing a form name.
This is the name that will appear in the Database pulldown in the main
window (actually, the pulldown should be called Form, but I fear that
would confuse casual users<!--<SUP><A HREF="#footnote">*</A></SUP>-->.
Every form references a database whose contents it presents; this name
must also be chosen. Typically, both names are the same.

<P>Both the form name and database names are also the file names the form
and the database will be stored in. The form name gets the extension
``.gf'', and non-procedural databases get the extension ``.db'' tacked
on if the names are not fully qualified (i.e., do not begin with ``/''
or ``~''). If the database is procedural, the database file is a script,
and has no .db or any other extension. This script is executed to read
or write data.

<P>When a database or form is read, the path it was read from is stored;
when the database or form is changed, it is written back to that path.
When a new database is created, and its name does not begin with ``/''
or ``~''  as defined in the second line of the form editor, it is stored
in the same directory as its form file. The default is always ~/.grok.
The Help-&gt;Current Database popup (Ctrl-D) shows which paths are actually used.

<P>The database is a two-dimensional array of strings. The rows are called
<I>cards</I>, and the columns are called <I>fields</I>. Rows are separated
by newlines, and columns are separated by the field delimiter. The field
delimiter is a colon by default, but can be changed to any character.
The button accepts characters, octal constants <I>\nnn</I>, and the tab
character <TT>\t</TT>. Any character other than <I>\0</I> and newline
can be chosen; grok will properly escape the character when it appears
in a database string. Severe chaos may result if the delimiter character
is changed when the database already contains data.

<P>Databases can be marked read-only. A user accessing a database through
a form that is has the read-only flag set will not be able to change
any cards, and will not be able to write back.

<P>Turning on Timestamps/Synchronizable for a database creates a third
file, with the same path as the database file but with a <TT>.ts</TT>
extension.  This contains a timestamp for each row in the database
indicating when it was last modified.  This is currently only used to
display the "card created" and "last changed" dates displayed above
the card in the main window.  A future version of grok may support
maerging with synchronization to choose the most recent versions of
each line.<!-- I wouldn't count on it, though -->   It is recommended
that you turn this on, since it does not take a lot of disk space.

<P>A procedural database does not read a file, but calls a script that
provides the data in the same format that the file would contain. If
the <TT>procedural</TT> button is turned on, the referenced database
name is the name of the script, not of any database file. It may contain
options. When the database is read, grok appends the option <TT>"-r"</TT>
(read) and the form name as shown in the <TT>Form name</TT> button
(without prepending a path or appending an extension). When writing,
<TT>-w</TT> is appended instead of <TT>-r</TT>. The script must print
the data to stdout if <TT>-r</TT> is specified, or must accept the data
from stdin if <TT>-w</TT> is specified, separating columns with the field
delimiter character and separating rows with newlines. If the delimiter
or newlines appear in as part of a data string, it must be escaped with
a backslash.

<P>Some template control and search expression functions support
<A HREF="grammar.html#gi">interpreting strings as arrays</A>.  In
addition, some field types store multiple values in a single field
using this interpretation.  Array elements are delimited by the
defined Array elt delimiter, and any characters prefixed by the Array
elt escape are not special.  These two may not be the same, as that
would make representing empty array elements impossible.  They may be
the same as the dbase field delim, though.

<P>A comment can be specified that should give the name of the author
of the form, or special caveats. The comment is displayed only in the
form editor window.

<A NAME="mc">
<H2>Creating a Card</H2>

<P>After the general setup is done, fields can be arranged on a card
``canvas'', which has the same size and layout as the final card will
have, but doesn't look as nice and shows extra information. Fields appear
as blue rectangular boxes, some of which are divided in the middle
(depending on the field type). The current field, whose specification
is displayed in the form editor window, has a yellow background. A
field can be moved by left-clicking somewhere inside the field (but
not too close to an edge) and dragging. The size can be changed by
dragging one of the four edges, and the divider can also be dragged.
Fields should not overlap. The card canvas can be resized; fields
should not overlap the canvas window edges.

<P>The canvas is divided in two parts by a horizontal fat line. The
divider can be moved vertically by dragging the little square that
initially appears near the top right corner of the canvas. Everything
above the divider is the <I>static part</I>; everything below the divider
is the <I>card part</I>. The card part displays one row of the database
if one is selected; this information changes frequently whenever a search
is performed or a row is chosen from the summary.

<P>The static part does not normally change, it is intended for static
data such as the average of all fields, a chart displaying statistics,
or buttons. This part is not entirely static because entering new cards
or resorting the database may change data, but it is not bound to a
particular card, and it remains accessible if no card is chosen. This
makes it a good place to place form switch buttons that would otherwise
become unavailable when no card is displayed.

<P>There are several types of fields. Not all of them store data in the
database; some are decorative or display computed information.  Unless
otherwise stated, all field types are in-database values that should
not be put into the static part of the canvas.

<UL>
<LI><B>Input</B><BR>
	This is the main type of field. It displays an editable (unless
	turned off) string in the database, along with a label.<P>

<LI><B>Number</B><BR>
	Input fields may be interpreted as numbers, but their format
	and values are not enforced.  The Number field enforces a
	numeric format and a specific range.<P> 

<LI><B>Time</B><BR>
	A variation of the Input field. The database representation is
	a number of seconds. It is displayed as a date, as a time, as
	both date and time, and as a duration. The first three assume
	the database string to be a number of seconds since January 1,
	1970; the last simply assumes a number of seconds up to 86399
	(one day minus 1 second). When a string is entered into a Time
	field, it is converted to the numeric representation, reformatted,
	and reprinted. Time fields are useful because they can be used in
	expressions for calculation; expressions always see the numeric
	database string.<P>

<LI><B>Note</B><BR>
	A note is a multi-line Input field. It should be used only
	for multi-line text input because it cannot be tabbed over, and
	because pressing Return when entering data into the card into
	a Note actually inserts a newline, rather than skipping to the
	next field as an Input-type field would.<P>

<LI><B>Choice</B><BR>
	Unlike all other types, many choice fields reference the same
	database string. They all must have the same summary column, the
	same database column, and the same internal field name (these
	three are buttons in the form editor). They differ only in the
	Choice/flag code. grok always makes sure that only one of the
	choice fields with identical internal field names can be active
	at any time; the database string then matches the Choice/flag
	code of that field. Most attributes of a <TT>Choice</TT> item,
	when changed, are copied to all other <TT>Choice</TT> items that
	have the same internal name.<P>

<LI><B>Choice Group</B><BR>
	Choice groups are multiple Choice buttons, automatically
	arranged in a grid, and surrounded by a border.  Each button
	has a label, unique code, and optional summary display code
	specified in the Menu table.  The main label, if non-blank, is
	displayed as part of the border.  Unlike Choice fields, these
	may not share a field name and database column with other
	fields; all choices for this field must be within this
	group.<P>

<LI><B>Choice Menu</B><BR>
	A choice menu collects the buttons in a Choice Group into a
	single button which allows selection of the choice with a
	pop-up menu.  Configuration is the same as with choice groups,
	except that the main label is displayed to the left of the
	button.<P>

<LI><B>Label</B><BR>
	Labels are purely decorative. They print an arbitrary one-line
	string at a position in the card. There is no associated database
	string. Labels are rarely needed because most of the other types
	come with their own built-in label parts. The label is static,
	expressions cannot be used. Label fields are useful in both
	the static and card parts of the canvas.<P>

<LI><B>Print</B><BR>
	Print fields are like Input fields, but no text can be
	entered. Unlike labels, they can display an expression specified
	in the Input Default button of the form editor. This can be
	used to display a running average or sum in cards, or display
	other computed information. There is no associated database
	string. Print fields are useful in both the static and card
	parts of the canvas.<P>

<LI><B>Flag</B><BR>
	Flags are boolean database strings: the string either
	matches the predefined string (<I>true</I>), or it is empty
	(<I>false</I>). (In fact, a string that doesn't match is also
	considered <I>false</I>, but this is not part of the normal
	operation.) The string that constitutes <I>true</I> is specified
	with the Choice/flag code button in the form editor.<P>

<LI><B>Flag Group</B><BR>
	Flag groups are the same a Choice Groups, except that multiple
	(or no) flags may be set at one time (and the checkbox also
	usually looks different).  These can either be assigned to a
	single field, or split into one field per flag using the
	Multi-field checkbox.  When assigned to a single field, the
	value stored in the database is a string-as-set, with all set
	flags' codes in the set.  This means, among other things, that
	all flag codes must be unique within the group.  See
	<A HREF="grammar.html#gi">the grammar documentation</A>
	for more details on how to deal with sets.  Configuration of
	single-field groups is the same as for Choice Groups.<P>

	For multi-field groups, the Menu table allows configuration of
	individual flags' database column and field name, as well.
	It is no longer required that codes be unique, like normal
	Flag fields.  The flag's summary column and width are also
	individually configurable.<P>

<LI><B>Flag List</B><BR>
	This is a scrollable list of flag options; clicking one toggles it.
	In all other ways it is the same as a Flag Group.<P>

<LI><B>Button</B><BR>
	Buttons have an associated action expression that is executed when
	the button is pressed. This action could start a shell script,
	for example.  Buttons are not associated with any database string,
	but the expression can access one. For example, a database of demo
	programs can have a button that executes the program. The returned
	string is executed, there is no need to use the <TT>system</TT>
	keyword unless nesting is desired. Note that the action expression
	is the only type of expression that may contain <TT>switch</TT>
	statements; see the Expression Grammar chapter for details. It
	is often a good idea to put buttons in the static part of the
	canvas.<P>

<LI><B>Chart</B><BR>
	Charts display data as bar or line charts. The X axis is divided
	into one slot per row in the database; the Y axis depends on the
	values computed from those rows (X and Y may be exchanged). Each
	chart contains one or more <I>components</I>. A component computes
	values that is plotted in the chart; a chart may display more
	than one value. For example, an expense account chart may display
	a stacked bar chart consisting of different color-coded types of
	costs, each described by a component.  There are many variations
	for configuring charts and their components.  Charts should be
	put into the static part of the canvas.<P>

<LI><B>Reference</B><BR>
	A reference field is a reference to another database.  The
	value stored in this database must match one or more fieds in the
	other database.  This match must be unique:  only one row is
	matched.  Multi-reference reference fields match more than one
	row by storing more than one value to match.  The matching field(s)
	and the field(s) to display in the current form may be separate.
	For example, an ID field may be the key to match, but the fields
	to display are the name and short description.  Selection of the
	value is via menus for the displayed fields.  This means that each
	combination of visible fields must be unique in the other database,
	just like each set of key fields.  The other database generally
	does not know about the reference, so it must be told in order for
	some features to work, either by adding this database to the other's
	form's Referers list, or by adding Referer field to the other database
	referencing this database.  The label of a Reference field is an
	HTML-style link which switches to the other database, with the
	card referred to by this one selected for editing.<P>

	Grok cannot generally enforce consistency of reference fields.  The
	<B>File</B> menu option <B>Check References</B> should be run regularly
	in order to at least check the consistency.<P>

<LI><B>Referers</B><BR>
	A referers field displays data from all cards of another database which
	refer to this card in a table.  The Reference field referring to this
	database must be specified as the key, and may not be displayed (since
	it just repeats data in the current card).  Under the table
	appear four buttons:  <TT>Refresh</TT> (cycle symbol), <TT>Add</TT>
	(plus), <TT>Remove</TT> (minus), and <TT>Edit</TT> (Open Document
	symbol).  The <TT>Refresh</TT> button reloads the table contents,
	in case the foreign database was modified.  The <TT>Add</TT> button
	adds a new card to the foreign database, and pops up a card form to
	edit it (the Reference field pointing to this card is initialized
	and uneditable).  The <TT>Edit</TT> button also pops up a card form,
	but to edit the selected table row.  The <TT>Remove</TT> button
	removes the row from the table, either by clearing the Reference
	field (the default) or by deleting the entire foreign card; the user
	is asked which action to perform.  Like reference fields,
	the label is an HTML-style link to the other database.  This
	switches to the other databse in a special parent-restricted mode,
	where the specified key field is restricted to point to the card
	from which the link was pressed.<P>

	A special degenerate form of this widget can also be made.  If the
	label takes up the entire widget, the referer field needs and allows
	no displayed foreign fields.  In this case, the widget is just the
	label as the HTML-style link to the referer database (in parent
	restricted mode).<P>

</UL>

<P>Each field has a number of parameters that depend on the type. The most
important is the internal field name. It must be unique, except for choice
fields which are grouped by assigning common internal field names. If the
field references a database string, the internal field name also names
the database string. The internal field name can be used in expressions
to read the database string. For example, suppose you have a database
of backup tapes, you may have an <TT>Input</TT> field with an internal
field name <I>capacity</I>, and another <TT>Input</TT> field named
<I>used</I>. You could then add a <TT>Print</TT> field whose Input Default
expression is <TT>(_capacity&nbsp;-&nbsp;_used)</TT>. The <TT>Print</TT>
field then displays the remaining free space on each tape, even though
the database only contains total capacity and used capacity. Another
<TT>Print</TT> label may have an expression <TT>(sum(_used))</TT>,
which displays a running total of all tapes' contents. <TT>sum</TT>
is one of a group of functions that loop over all cards rather than
just referencing the current card; see the Expression Grammar chapter
for details. It is also possible to reference a database field for which
there is no field description in an expression; in this case, the field is
referenced by number. Fields in the database are numbered left to right,
beginning with 0.

<P>The next button in the form editor is the database column. It needs
to be specified only for field types that display the column and allow
entry into the column. These fields are ``windows'' into the database;
there is normally one field for each database column. All fields that
do not reference a database column are merely decoration, no change
of the database is possible through such a decorative field (although
the decorative field may read the database, as <TT>Print</TT> fields
do). <!-- and anything with an expression can modify the database; in
fact, that's one good use for buttons. -->  This relation between
fields and database columns also serves to give a symbolic name to
database columns; these symbolic names can be used in expressions by
prefixing them with an underscore. (It is also possible to use the
column number in expressions, but that is less convenient).

<P>The main window has three parts, a summary, the static area, and the
card.  The summary contains one line per card, while the card contains
the entire card's information as defined with the form editor and the card
canvas. The static part is optional and programmed in the same way as the
card. The Summary column and Width in summary buttons in the form editor
determine which fields also appear in the summary; this is a subset of
the fields that reference a database column (decoration fields can not
be put into the summary).  The two buttons specify the order in database
column and the width in characters. Two blanks are inserted between
fields in the summary automatically. The summary has a title; it can
not be specified directly but is taken from the Label text of the field.

<P>Here is a brief summary of all buttons in the form editor that specify
a field in the card:

<UL>
<LI><B>Field type</B><BR>
	The type of a field is entered here. See above for a list of
	available types and what they do.<P>

<LI><B>Searchable</B><BR>
	The main window contains a Search input button. It searches
	through all cards and puts all cards containing the search string
	into the summary.  Fields that are not searchable are excluded
	from the search.<P>

<LI><B>Read only</B><BR>
	The user cannot change the database string referenced by a
	field that is read-only. This is useful if there are two forms
	referencing the same database, one for you and one for the
	unwashed masses with lots of read-only flags set. The read-only
	flag can also be set for the entire database with the button near
	the top of the form editor window; setting that flag overrides
	all field read-only flags.<P>

<LI><B>Not sortable</B><BR>
	The field will be omitted from the Sort pulldown in the main
	menu.<P>

<LI><B>Default sort</B><BR>
	When the file is read in from disk, it is sorted by the field
	that has this flag on. Setting it in any field will clear the
	Default sort flag in all other items automatically. If no field
	has the Default sort flag, the file will not be sorted when it is
	read. It is possible but not recommended to have both the Default
	sort flag and the Not sortable flag on in the same field.<P>

<LI><B>Multi-field</B><BR>
	Flag Groups and Flag Lists may either store their values as a
	string-as-set in a single column, or use a separate column for
	every flag.  Checking this enables the latter.  When checked,
	the Internal field name, Database column, Summary column and
	Width in summary fields are moved to the Menu table, because
	they are specified separately for each flag.<P>

<LI><B>Headers</B><BR>
	Selecting this option displays field labels from the other database
	above the displayed fields in the Reference and Referers widgets.<P>

<LI><B>Subsearch</B><BR>
	Selecting this option cretes a text field below the displayed fields.
	Text entered there is used to query the other database, and filters
	the editor menus and/or multi-item listing.<P>

<LI><B>Multi-Ref</B><BR>
	Reference fields may refer to more than one card in the other database
	by storing multiple keys in a set.  This changes the display
	from a row of selection menus to a table listing the current values,
	each as a row of selection menus, plus a blank row at the end.<P>

<LI><B>Internal field name</B><BR>
	All fields have an unique name. Choice names are not unique,
	choice fields are grouped by a common name. If the field
	references a database string, the internal field name also names
	the database column, which can then be accessed in expressions
	symbolically.<P>

<LI><B>Database column</B><BR>
	If the field references a database column, this button says
	which one, 0 being the first column. If not, this button is
	grayed out. The column number must be unique, except for choice
	fields which are grouped by a common database column (and a
	common internal field name, too).<P>

<LI><B>Summary column</B><BR>
	If the width is nonzero, this value specifies the order of fields
	in summary lines. No two fields may have the same summary column
	number, but there may be gaps.<P>

<LI><B>Width in summary</B><BR>
	If the width is nonzero, the database string referenced by the
	field will appear in the summary, with as many characters as
	specified. Two blanks are appended in the textual outputs.<P>
	
	Multi-line data is normally truncated to one line, but a
	form-wide setting (<I>Max Sum row ht</I>) can be increased to
	allow more than one line.  This setting affects built-in
	template output as well.  Be aware that in the GUI, any multi-line
	data affects the height of all rows.

<LI><B>Show in summary</B><BR>
	If this is non-blank, the text displayed for this field in the
	summary is the result of evaluating this as an expression.  Unlike
	Shown in Summary as, this applies to all field types.<P>

<LI><B>Choice/flag code</B><BR>
	The string that Flag and Choice fields store in the database,
	if active.  No two Choice fields with the same internal name
	may have the same code.<P>

<LI><B>Shown in summary as</B><BR>
	If this string is set, it will be displayed in the summary in
	place of the choice/flag code. Basically, it is a mnemonic name
	for the choice/flag code that a user can understand.  Unlike Show
	in summary, this is never interpreted as an expression.<P>

<LI><B>Time format</B><BR>
	Time fields have four different formats, as described above. The
	format controls what gets printed into the card, and how user
	input is interpreted.  In addition, the entry widget can be a
	widget designed specially for date entry by selecting the Widget
	checkbox.  This provides cursor/spin box adjustment of date fields,
	as well as a calendar popup for dates.  However, it limits
	durations to less than 24 hours, reduces the amount of space for
	display, and disallows entry of several grok-supported special
	values, such as "tomorrow".<P>

<LI><B>Label justification</B><BR>
	Labels can be centered, left-aligned, or right-aligned. This is
	not shown in the card canvas, press the Preview button to see
	the effect.<P>

<LI><B>Label font</B><BR>
	The font used for the label. Five fonts are available.<P>

<LI><B>Label text</B><BR>
	All field types come with some kind of text string that is
	printed into the field in the card. This string is always literal,
	it cannot be an expression.<P>

<LI><B>Input justification</B><BR>
	Input can be centered, left-aligned, or right-aligned. This is
	not shown in the card canvas, press the Preview button to see
	the effect.<P>

<LI><B>Input font</B><BR>
	The font used for the input area. Five fonts are available. It is
	recommended to use Courier for Note fields (and, by extension,
	for Input and Time fields) because printing functions print
	notes using a fixed-width font.<P>

<LI><B>Max input length</B><BR>
	The maximum number of characters than can be entered into an
	Input, Time, or Note field. The default is 100 for Input and
	Time fields, and 10000 for Note fields. Always make sure that
	note fields have a sufficient maximum length. This number is
	passed to the Motif widget to limit input length, but does not
	lead to increased memory usage for the database.<P>

<LI><B>Min Value</B>
	The minimum value permitted in a numeric field.  The minimum
	allowable value is determined by the platform's double-precision
	floating point range, usualy approximately
	-1.8*10<SUP>308</SUP>.<P>

<LI><B>Max Value</B>
	The maximum value permitted in a numeric field.  The maximum
	value allowed in this field is determined by the platform's
	double-precision floating-point range, usually approximately
	1.8*10<SUP>308</SUP>.  If this is the same as the minimum
	value, a default range is used, instead.  The default maximum
	value is always the platform's maximum floating-point value
	when digits is non-zero, and the platform's maximum accurately
	represented floating-point integer (usually 2<SUP>53</SUP>, or
	~9*10<SUP>15</SUP>) otherwise.  If the minimum value was
	non-negative, it is retained; otherwise, it is changed to the
	negative of the default maximum.<P>

<LI><B>Digits</B>
	The number of digits past the decimal point to retain in
	numeric fields.<P>

<LI><B>Input default</B><BR>
	For Input, Time, Flag, and Choice fields, this field provides the
	defaults when a new card is added to the database. It can be an
	expression. For Print fields, the Input default specifies what
	gets printed into the inset area of the field; input default is
	actually a misnomer because Print field texts cannot be input
	and are evaluated whenever the database changes, not just when
	a new card is added. In general, Choice fields should always
	have a default. If the field has type Time, the input default
	expression should evaluate to a number of seconds, not to a
	string containing a date. For example, to make the Time field
	default to today, use (date), not {date}.<P>

<LI><B>Menu</B><BR>
	For input fields, this attaches a menu to the input field with
	suggested values.  The table to the left can be filled with
	predefined values.  The checkboxes to the right are for
	filling the menu with existing values in the database, as well.
	Static indicates that only the predefined values are used, if
	any.  Dynamic indicates that values of this field from the
	current search results are added below the predefined ones.
	All indicates that values of this field from the entire
	database are added below the predefined ones.<P>

	For Choice Group, Choice Menu, Flag Group and Flag List
	fields, this configures the individual choices and flags.  The
	Label, Code and Sum Code columns correspond to individual
	fields' Label text, Choice/flag code and shown in summary
	configuration, respectively.  In addition, for multi-field
	Flag Group and Flag List fields, Field Name, DB Col, Sum Col,
	Sum Width columns are added, which correspond to the Internal
	field name, Database column, Summary column and Width in
	summary configuration, respectively.<P>

	The bottom row of the table is always blank, and is therefore
	ignored.  To add a new row, fill in the blank one, and a new
	blank row will appear below it for further additions.<P>

	Below the table are four buttons which operate on the
	currently selected table row, which is the last row clicked on
	or tabbed into; this is usually indicated by highligting the
	row.  The arrow buttons move the selected row up and down in
	the list.  The Delete button removes the current row (with no
	undo!), and the Duplicate button copies the selected row to the
	immediately following row.<P>

<LI><B>Foreign DB</B><BR>
	For Reference and Referers fields, this is the other database.
	It is actually the name (or path to) a form, rather than a raw
	database file.<P>

<LI><B>Foreign Fields</B><BR>
	For Reference and Referers fields, this species the fields to
	match (key fields) and the fields to display.  The Key and
	Display checkboxes select how a field is used.  The pull-down
	menu selects a field from the other databse.  Selecting a field
	in the bottom row adds it to the list, and clearing a field
	selection in the list deletes it.<P>

	Note that order matters.  The order of fields, top to bottom, with
	the display flag set is the order in which the fields are displayed
	in the card window.  For Reference fields, multiple key fields are
	stored as a single array value in the database.  The order of this
	array is the order, from top to bottom, of the fields marked as
	keys.<P>
	
	Changing the list of key fields in Reference field definitions in
	any way will invalidate all data currently stored in the Reference
	field.<P>

<LI><B>Calendar interface</B><BR>
	If the <I>plan</I> calendar program (see below) reads a grok
	database, it starts <I>grok</I> with the -p option, which uses
	the calendar interface settings to interpret the fields of
	the database. At least one field must be marked <TT>Date</TT>
	or <TT>Date+time</TT>; <I>plan</I> will use the value in that
	field to display the card in the calendar at the given date. There
	should also be a field marked <TT>Note</TT> or <TT>Message</TT>;
	this will become the label of the calendar item that is shown
	along with the date. For the interpretation of the other interface
	modes, refer to the online help of the <I>plan</I> program.<P>

<LI><B>Shown in calendar if</B><BR>
	If defined, <I>plan</I> will only display cards that match the
	expression entered here. The expression is shared by all fields.
	<I>plan</I> may override this expression by specifying a <TT>-p
	</TT> query expression on the command line. This requires <I>
	plan</I> version 1.9 or higher.<P>

<LI><B>Grayed out if</B><BR>
	If the named expression evaluates to <I>true</I>, the field
	is grayed out and cannot be used to alter the database. The
	expression is evaluated every time the database changes.<P>

<LI><B>Invisible if</B><BR>
	If the named expression evaluates to <I>true</I>, the field is
	excluded from the card. The expression is evaluated every time
	the database changes. This can be used to hide entries if the
	wrong user has read the database. Invisibility does not affect
	the summary.<P>

<LI><B>Read-only if</B><BR>
	If the named expression evaluates to <I>true</I>, the field
	is read-only.  The expression is evaluated only once, when the
	database is read from disk.<P>

<LI><B>Skip if</B><BR>
	Normally, pressing Return or Tab in an Input or Time field
	advances the cursor to the next field (fields are ordered by
	their bottom left corner, in Y-major order). If the named
	expression of the next field evaluates to <I>true</I>, the
	field is skipped and the cursor is put elsewhere. This
	expression is evaluated every time return or tab is pressed in
	the revious field.  A constant expression such as <TT>true</TT>
	is also useful.<P>

<LI><B>Action when pressed</B><BR>
	If the button is pressed, this expression is evaluated. The
	result is ignored. Typically, the expression is the name of
	a shell script. The expression may use the <TT>switch</TT>
	statement, which switches to another database and/or performs
	a query on all cards.<P>

<LI><B>Chart flags</B><BR>
	Not documented yet. This part of the menu is still under
	development.<P>
	<!-- FIXME:  all undocumented features are bugs...  either
	             document it, replace it or chuck it -->

</UL>

<P>Some of the above accept expressions. An expression begins with a
parenthesis, a brace, or a dollar sign. Everything else is a literal
string. Parentheses and braces are numeric and string expressions,
respectively; a dollar sign followed by an environment variable is a
shortcut for the same sequence enclosed in braces. The <TT>system</TT>
statement should be used sparingly, because some expressions (such as the
grayed-out-if expression) are evaluated frequently. See the Expression
Grammar section for details.

<A NAME="md">
<H2>Buttons</H2>

<P>There is a row of buttons in the form editor for various operations:

<UL>
<LI><B>Queries</B><BR>
	Starts up a window that allows entry of standard queries,
	as name/expression pairs. The name is what will appear in the
	Query pulldown in the main menu; the expression is what gets
	executed if the name is selected in the pulldown.  When a name
	is selected, the expression is applied to all cards in the
	database, and those that return <I>true</I> are put into the
	summary. For example, assuming your database has an Input field
	with the internal name <TT>value</TT>, the query expression
	<TT>(_value&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;avg(_value))</TT> will select all
	cards whose value is above average.One of the queries can be
	selected as the default query that will be performed when the
	database is read from disk.<P>

<LI><B>Referers</B><BR>
	Starts up a window that allows entry of databases referring to
	this one.  Some operations, such as cascade deletes and SQL template
	export, rely on a list of referring database to work properly.
	Databases used in Referers fields are automatically added to this
	list.<P>

<LI><B>Def Help</B><BR>
	The main window has a help button in the lower left corner. This
	button pops up a help window with some generic info about
	grok. With the Def Help button, more text can be entered that
	will be appended to the generic help text. The text should
	explain the card, how to use it, and what the fields mean.<P>

<LI><B>Debug</B><BR>
	This button checks the consistency of all fields, and reports
	conflicts such as non-unique internal names or redundant choice
	flags. At this time, expressions are not checked. If the Debug
	button reports nothing, the no problems were found. The Done
	button always does a debugging run first, and refuses to exit
	if errors were found.<P>

<LI><B>Preview</B><BR>
	The card canvas shows the layout of fields in the card, as boxes
	that show additional information such as type, database column,
	flag/choice code, and summary column. This does not reflect
	the final card that the user will see very well; in particular,
	whether a label string fits into the field on the card canvas does
	not mean that the same label will fit into the final card. Preview
	shows precisely what the card will look like.<P>

<LI><B>Help</B><BR>
	Print general help information.<P>

<LI><B>Cancel</B><BR>
	Discards all operations done with the form editor since it was
	installed, and removes the form editor window after asking for
	confirmation.<P>

<LI><B>Done</B><BR>
	Check all fields for consistency. If no problems are found, the
	form file is written. The file name is taken from the Form name
	button at the top of the form, with <TT>~/.grok</TT> prepended
	and <TT>.gf</TT> appended if appropriate.<P>

<LI><B>Add</B><BR>
	Adds a new field to the card. Its type, parameters, and position
	on the card canvas are chosen based on the currently selected
	card, so it's a good idea to select a field that is similar to the
	new one before pressing Add. If the card canvas has no free space
	below the bottom field, the new field may be placed under the
	bottom field where it can't be seen; it is generally a good idea
	to start with a card canvas that is too large and resize it to the
	correct size after all fields have been added and positioned.<P>

<LI><B>Delete</B><BR>
	Delete the currently selected field. There is no Undo function
	to get it back.<P>

</UL>


<A NAME="me">
<H2><I>plan</I> Interface</H2>

<P>grok cooperates with the calendar manager <I>plan</I>,
which is another freeware package by the same author. See <A
HREF="http://www.bitrot.de"</A>http://www.bitrot.de</A> for more
information about <I>plan</I>. The standard FTP archive site is
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/unix/graphics/plan">
ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/unix/graphics/plan</A>.

<P>Version 1.6 of <I>plan</I> and version 1.4 of grok support a simple
mode of cooperation. <I>plan</I> can read databases created with grok and
displays the information in various way in its calendar views. Version 1.9
of <I>plan</I> uses the new <TT>-p</TT> option of <I>grok</I> to read
databases, which permits the use of the <I>Shown in calendar if</I> mode
in the form editor, which can be used to show only active and unfinished
todo items from a workplan database, for example. Previous versions always
show all cards.

<P>This is useful only for databases that are time-based, which means
that they have at least one field of type <I>Time</I> with a subtype
<TT>Date+time</TT> or <TT>Date</TT>. Currently, <I>plan</I>'s IP server
options are not available for grok; this will change in a future version.
At this time, <I>plan</I> can only display but not modify grok data.

<P><I>plan</I> needs information about a grok database to know how to
interpret the data. For this purpose, the calendar interface mode was
introduced in the form editor. It allows the user to specify for each
field of the database how <I>plan</I> should interpret it. One field must
be marked <TT>Date+time</TT> or <TT>Date</TT>, and one field should be
marked <TT>Note</TT> or <TT>Message</TT> so the entry can meaningfully
be displayed in a calendar view.

<P>The standard <I>workplan</I> application that comes bundled with
grok is set up to display the finish dates of jobs in calendar views,
along with the job title.
