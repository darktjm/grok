<P>This is a complete list of all files and directories required for grok:

<TABLE CELLPADDING=4 BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=4>
<TR BGCOLOR=#a0a0e0><TH>file<TH>location<TH>contents
<TR> <TD><TT>grok</TT>      <TD> ${GROK_BIN}   <TD> main executable
<TR> <TD><TT>grok.hlp</TT>  <TD> ${GROK_LIB}   <TD> ascii help texts
<TR> <TD><TT>index.html</TT><TD> ${GROK_DOC}/html   <TD> this HTML manual
<TR> <TD><TT>grokdir</TT>   <TD> ${GROK_LIB}   <TD> demo application directory
<TR> <TD><TT>.grok</TT>     <TD> <TT>~</TT>        <TD> default form and database directory
<TR> <TD><TT>.grokrc</TT>   <TD> <TT>~/.grok</TT>  <TD> configuration data for grok
<TR> <TD><TT>Grok.xpm</TT>  <TD> ${GROK_ICON}  <TD> full-color icon
</TABLE>

<P>Every grok application consists of one ``form'' file and one or more
``database'' files. The form file describes the card layout and the data
interpretation; they have the extension <TT>.gf</TT>. The name of the
form file without the extension is put into the Database pulldown in the
main window. The default location for form files is the <TT>~/.grok</TT>
directory.

<P>The form references data files. Normally, they have the same name as
the form file but with the extension <TT>.db</TT>, and are also stored
in the <TT>~/.grok</TT> directory. If the resulting path references a
directory instead of a file, the contents of this directory is searched.
Every file in this directory also ends in <TT>.db</TT> and becomes a
section that is put into the Section pulldown. If the directory contains
subdirectories, they are searched for more <TT>.db</TT> files recursively.

<P>grok searches for form files in four locations, in the following order:

<OL>
<LI> $GROK_FORM, if defined; otherwise the current directory
<LI> ./grokdir,
<LI> ~/.grok,
<LI> ${GROK_LIB}/grokdir
</OL>

<P>All the form files ending with <TT>.gf</TT> found in these directories
are put into the Database pulldown. Form files from different directories
are separated by an etched line. grok attempts to recognize and eliminate
duplicate form files found over two different paths, but puts duplicate
form files that it thinks are in different directories into the pulldown
multiple times. This can be disabled with the preferences menu.
