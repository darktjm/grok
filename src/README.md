Graphical Resource Organizer Kit
================================

This is an old motif-based generic personal database application.  My
first introduction to the concept came from Fiasco on the Amiga
(http://aminet.net/search?name=fiasco).  Unlike Fiasco, this is for
UNIX, and is also free software.  Since I actually implemented a
database using it, I have verified that it works with OpenMotif 2.3.8
on Linux.  I make no guarantees for any other target.  I have
addressed a few bugs I found adequately (but not fully).  That's what
this repository is: xmbase_grok 1.5 from
ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/unix/graphics/grok/xmbase_grok-1.5.tar.gz
with a few extra fixes (I have taken the liberty to update the version
to 1.5.1).  See the README for information on the original and it
suthor (who no longer acknowledges its existence on his own site); I
take no credit for this application.  I am working on a similar
application that works a little differently, but I thought I'd release
this now that it's usable.
