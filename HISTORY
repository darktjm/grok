    highlights the next card that matches the search in the summary table
    without creating a new summary table like the others.

    the last summary listing after a search.
  * the HTML export templates were much improved.
  * all cards now get a unique timestamp and identifier when they are created.
    It is saved in a separate file "name.ts". Timestamps are displayed in the

    flag and choice fields.
  * the printer line length is now configurable in the preferences dialog.

    the (forthcoming) plan calendar 1.9. A default query string can be defined
    in the form editor to send only a subset of the database to plan.
  * when procedural databases were written successfully, the modified flags
    were not reset. Fix by Fredy Paquet <fredy@gilera.opag.ch>
  * the default year was incorrect, it defaulted to 2000 instead of 2001

SVN revision 494 is the last version that is basically the same as
xmbase_grok-1.5.  I'd tag it in git for git users, but I can't get
that to work right.  Maybe I'll fix that some day.

version 1.5.1, SVN ID 494, released 26.10.18

  * fewer segfaults in templates
  * don't pop up new error dialog for every record on search expr error
  * multi-line text widget now works correclty in Motif 2.3.8
  * code now compiles with g++
  * other minor cleanups that may make this break in ancient unix

Sub-minor revisions to the below may be released due to my inability
to move tags to different locations, and consist purely of minor
tweaks I forgot for the previous tagged release.

version 2.0, released 11.14.18

  * updated README to be more like old one (but renamed to README.md)
  * added a substantial todo list, in case I don't abandon this soon
  * replaced Motif with Qt; bye bye systems that don't support it
    Everything looks and works a little differently.  In particular,
    X11-style resources are gone.  However, the underlying applicaiton
    is still pretty much the same as with 1.5.
    * Qt Syle Sheets can now be used for styling instead of X
      resources.  There is a built-in style sheet, which is overridden
      by grok.qss in any of the standard locations (e.g. you can delete
      the built-in qss by creating a 0-length grok.qss), and can be
      augmented by -stylesheet=<file> on the command-line.
    * Summary header is now absorbed into summary list widget, meaning
      that fixed-width fonts are not relied on for alignment
    * Context help becomes "What's This?".  It looks pretty ugly, and
      probably needs configuration.
    * GUI numeric inputs have become Qt "Spin Boxes", which ensure that
      input is numeric, and also allows adjustment with arrows.  This
      can't be done automatically for database fields, because there is
      no indicator of type on inputs.
    * Instead of just disabling irrelevant widgets in the form item editor
      form, the new GUI actually hides those widgets.  For example, the
      only time you see the huge chart options section is when editing a
      chart item.
    * Item type is now a popup menu button, so more item types can be
      added without the list extending infinitely to the right.
  * by sheer coincidence, fixed a few buffer overflow bugs
  * fixed some missing/wrong docs while adding qt-related info
  * removed #if 0-d features; if they haven't been implemented since 2001,
    they probably never will:
    * separator before summary header
    * View:  a summary window on another database (I will do something
      similar for the foreign key feature later).  Note that q_dbase,
      query, q_summ, q_first, q_last will no longer written to/read from
      the .gf file.
    * min field length.  I will convert this to a non-empty flag.  It
      could also be validated by my suggested input pattern replacement.
      Note that minlen will no longer be written to/read from the .gf file.
    * Input pattern:  this may be a good idea some time in the future as
      a field validator, but as an expression.  For this, regex support
      should be in the expressions.  Note that pattern will no longer be
      written to/read from the .gf file. (added to TODO.md)
    * Many chart-related options.  The whole chart thing needs to be
      rethought, anyway.  I have no intention of re-implementing gdchart
      here.  Note that ch_label, ch_xexpr, ch_yexpr, will no longer be written to/read
      from the .gf file.
  * Now uses the color application icon.  The old icon is still there for
    reference, but I'm not even going to bother packaging it.

Version 2.1
    * The conditional expressions (Grayed out if,  ...) are now combo
      boxes, to make it easier to set groups of widgets to the same
      expression (not that copy/paste doesn't work well, too)
    * Added regular expression functions match, sub, gsub.  Also, since
      backslash-substitution isn't done anywhere else (except "), bsub.
    * Added string length operator #
    * Added string-as-array/set support: esc ## s[] s[]->v toset |+ |- |*
      and foreach() and \{FOREACH} for arrays & sets.
    * \{QUIT} now works
